- seeing this utility post i came to conclusion that its from Taiwan, China
- when i researched more about the poles of Taiwan i realised that there's a website to search for a Taipower pole by its standardized code
- so i merely entered our given code 'N0489BE61' to the site which gave me the precise location
- pinpointing this to the map gave me the flag (which i forgot to save)
