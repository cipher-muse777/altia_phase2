# 1. IQ TEST 
let your input x = 30478191278.
wrap your answer with nite{ } for the flag.
As an example, entering x = 34359738368 gives (y0, ..., y11), so the flag would be nite{010000000011}.

## SOLUTION 
- manually solved the logic gates, where i first converted the number to binary 011100011000101001000100101010101110

nite{100010011000}

## CONCEPTS LEARNED
