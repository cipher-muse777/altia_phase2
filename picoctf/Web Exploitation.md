# 1.   Web Gauntlet 
Can you beat the filters?
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## SOLUTION
- After clicking Launch Instance we get 2 links http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:60436/ and http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:60436/filter.php
- one has a login page like this

- and the other is a filter site with the word "or"
- while reading hints we realise that we shouldn't be using valid creditionals and must use sqlite.
- so came to the conclusion of using sql injections payloads and not use "or" for round one 
- admin' -- with random password helped pass into round 2

- now the filter website becomes "or and like = --" so, i use admin'/*

- now filter website becomes "or and = like > < --" so i use the same admin'/*

- now filter website becomes "or and = like > < -- union admin" so i once again use ad'||'min'/*

## FLAG 
picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_79a0ddc6}

## CONCEPTS LEARNED 
- how sql injection is a powerful tool to bypass the restrictions by injecting malicious SQL code into a query that an application sends to its database.
- how different payloads help us bybass different filters
- how || helps us combine two strings
