# 2. CUSTOM ENCRYPTION 
Can you get sense of this code file and write the function that will decode the given encrypted file content.
Find the encrypted file here flag_info and code file might be good to analyze and get the flag.

## SOLTUION 
- the given file revealed that it combined  XOR encryption with a multiplicative cipher.\
- the XOR key takes the message and mixes it up with the word "trudeau" and reversing the plaintext
- the multiplicative cipher, multiplies each letter by a particular number

- so to solve it we must first reverse the multiplication (divide by shared_key Ã— 311) and then reverse the XOR with "trudeau" again
```
cipher.append(((ord(char) * key*311)))
```
