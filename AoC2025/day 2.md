## SOLUTION 
- i first entered the respective directory by executing cd ~/Rooms/AoC2025/Day02
- then i ran the server.py file, so i can see every interaction done with our site
- now in a new tab i do setookit where from the menu i choose 1 for social engineering attacks
- and then i select 5 for mass mailer attack since we have to get the login details

- and since here we are only targetting a specific email only we select 1 for e-mail attack for single email address
- then i generate an email that looks believable

- now after the mail is obtained and they try logining into the site, we will be able to view the username and password which can be exploited

- now we know that the password is unranked-wisdom-anthem
- then when i tried logining in with admin it showed login failed
- so with respect to the question i tried factory as username and tried same password to login successfully and obtain the required details which was the number of units of toys (1984000)
